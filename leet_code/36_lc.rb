# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Note:

# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
#Example 1 
#Input: 
# board = 
# [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
# ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
# ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
# ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
# ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
# ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
# ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
# ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
# ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
# Output: true
#Example 2
# Input: 
board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
